# Errors and Issues in Joker-RN Program

This README documents the errors, potential issues, and suggestions found in the Joker-RN program (React Native mobile app with Node.js backend) after analyzing the code and performing basic testing.

## Summary of Findings

The program has several potential runtime errors, type mismatches, and UI/UX issues that could cause crashes or poor user experience. Below is a detailed list.


## 2. Type Mismatches (`mobile/types/index.ts`)

### Issue: Incomplete `User` Interface
- **Description**: The `User` type is missing several properties used in the profile screen:
  - `bio?: string`
  - `location?: string`
  - `createdAt: string`
  - `following?: string[]`
  - `followers?: string[]`
  - `bannerImage?: string`
- **Impact**: TypeScript errors or runtime issues if backend returns these fields.
- **Fix**: Update the `User` interface to include all expected properties.

## 3. Modal Handling Issues (`mobile/components/EditProfileModal.tsx`)

### Issue: Premature Modal Closure
- **Description**: In `handleSave`, `onClose()` is called immediately after `saveProfile()`, but `saveProfile` is asynchronous. The modal closes before the save completes, and if there's an error, the modal stays closed but an alert shows.
- **Impact**: Poor UX - user thinks save is done, but it's not; error handling is confusing.
- **Fix**: Remove `onClose()` from `handleSave`. Let the `useProfile` hook handle closing on success (`onSuccess: setIsEditModalVisible(false)`).

### Issue: Form Data Initialization
- **Description**: If `currentUser` is null in `useProfile`, `formData` remains empty, but the modal still opens.
- **Impact**: Empty form fields, confusing for user.
- **Fix**: Prevent opening modal if `currentUser` is null, or show loading state.

## 4. Hook Issues

### Issue: `useProfile` Dependency on `useCurrentUser`
- **Description**: `useProfile` uses `useCurrentUser` internally, which could cause unnecessary re-renders or stale data.
- **Fix**: Consider passing `currentUser` as prop or using a different pattern.

### Issue: No Error Handling in Hooks
- **Description**: Hooks like `useCurrentUser` and `usePosts` return `error`, but components don't always handle it (e.g., profile screen ignores `error` from `useCurrentUser`).
- **Fix**: Add error states in UI, e.g., show error message if `currentUser` fails to load.

## 5. PostsList Component (`mobile/components/PostsList.tsx`)

### Issue: Selected Post State Management
- **Description**: `selectedPost` is derived from `posts.find()`, but if `posts` changes (e.g., refetch), `selectedPost` could become null while the comments modal is open.
- **Impact**: Comments modal might crash or show wrong data.
- **Fix**: Use a more robust state management, perhaps store the full post object or handle null in `CommentsModal`.

## 6. API and Backend Issues

### Issue: No Error Handling in API Calls
- **Description**: API calls in hooks don't have try-catch or specific error handling beyond React Query's default.
- **Fix**: Add custom error handling, e.g., show user-friendly messages.

### Issue: Backend Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: `npm audit` in backend shows 2 high severity vulnerabilities.
- **Fix**: Run `npm audit fix` or update dependencies.

## 7. General Issues

### Issue: Missing Fallbacks for Images
- **Description**: `currentUser.profilePicture` has no fallback; if null, image might not load.
- **Fix**: Provide a default image or placeholder.

### Issue: Inconsistent Import Paths
- **Description**: Some imports use relative paths, others use `@/` alias. Ensure consistency.

### Issue: No Loading States for Some Actions
- **Description**: Some async actions (e.g., sign out) don't show loading indicators.

## Testing Results

- **Backend**: Starts successfully on port 5001, database connects.
- **Mobile**: Dependencies install without errors, but linting was interrupted (may have errors).
- **Runtime**: Not fully tested due to React Native setup, but code analysis reveals potential crashes.

## Recommendations

1. Add comprehensive null checks and error boundaries.
2. Update TypeScript types to match backend API.
3. Improve modal and form handling for better UX.
4. Add proper error handling and user feedback.
5. Fix backend vulnerabilities.
6. Consider adding unit tests for hooks and components.
7. Run full linting and fix any reported issues.

## Next Steps

- Fix the critical runtime errors first (null checks).
- Test the app thoroughly on a device/emulator.
- Implement error logging (e.g., Sentry) for production.
